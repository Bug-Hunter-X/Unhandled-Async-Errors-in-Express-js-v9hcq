# Unhandled Async Errors in Express.js

This repo demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: failing to properly handle errors within asynchronous operations, leading to silent failures and unexpected behavior.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code.  The solution is provided in `bugSolution.js`.

## Problem

The example uses `someAsyncOperation()` which is a placeholder for an asynchronous task.  If this task fails (e.g., a database query fails, a network request times out), the `.catch` block logs the error, but the Express.js response cycle is not handled. This means that the client gets no response, leading to a poor user experience.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file shows how to correctly handle the error.  It uses the `next()` function to pass the error to Express.js's error-handling middleware.  This ensures that a proper error response (with appropriate HTTP status code) is sent to the client.   This approach also provides more robustness for handling edge cases and unexpected errors that occur during the request process.
